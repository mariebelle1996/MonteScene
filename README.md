# MonteScene

MonteScene is a python module that simplifies implementation of efficient search algorithms based on Monte Carlo Tree 
Search (MCTS), with optional simultaneous refinement, for applications in scene understanding. Through this module, we 
want to motivate and inspire developers and researchers to apply and further extend MonteScene for their own
 original applications. 
 
## Introduction

Historically, MCTS was commonly researched as an efficient search algorithm for playing games of high state-complexity 
such as Chess, Go, and Shogi. As we draw inspiration from these successes, we define a _Proposals Selection Game_  as a 
family of problems in scene understanding where our approach is applicable. 

_Proposals selection game_ is a very simple and a very general single-player game. We initialize our game by generating 
a large set of proposals and the goal of the game is to retrieve a subset which best describes the input scene. Then, 
a move in the game consists of selecting one proposal from the pool. As the rule of scene understanding dictates that 
some proposals are mutually incompatible, every time we pop one proposal from the pool, we remove all incompatible 
proposals from the pool as well. The game continues until the pool of proposals becomes empty, after which the game 
ends and the final score is calculated representing the fitness of the selected solution to the given scene. 

Our MonteScene implementation is used to efficiently find the optimal solution by replaying proposals selection game 
by balancing exploitation and exploration.

## Key Features

* Simple-to-use and flexible framework for integrating MonteScene (optionally with refinement) for any 
scene understanding problem that can be casted as a proposals selection game. 

* Framework integrates base classes ``Proposal``, ``Game``, and ``MCTSLogger`` with basic functionalities
that are common in all proposals selection games. Through class inheritance, it is easy to adapt base classes to a 
specific task by implementing task-specific functionalities (such as proposals generation, 
score calculation and visualizations). That is it! By modfying ``run.py`` script, the user can  quickly run MonteScene by 
following provided instructions in the script. 

* Flexible settings that enable/disable certain features.

* TODO Toy examples demonstrating how to use MonteScene for different applications in scene understanding.

* TODO Additional baselines (e.g. Hill Climbing) that are typically useful for demonstating advantages
of MonteScene.

MonteScene is a result of our findings from several publications. Hence, if you use MonteScene in your 
research project, please consider citing following papers:

* ["Monte Carlo Scene Search for 3D Scene Understanding"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07969) first generates a large set 
of proposals by fitting CAD models of furniture and structural elements to the input scene. Then, MonteScene is used to 
find the optimal subset which best describe the input scene.

*  ["MonteFloor: Extending MCTS for Reconstructing Accurate Large-Scale Floor Plans"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11161) 
introduces the refinement step. Hence, MonteScene jointly selects and refines proposals to improve the fitness with 
respect to the input scene.

with refinement scheme can be generalized to different problems in Scene Understanding.
